### Activity File: Using `awk`   
  
- You continue in your role as security analyst at Wonka Corp.

- Your manager still needs your help finding information on the cybercriminal attempting to log in to several administrative websites owned by Wonka.

- You are now tasked with isolating several fields from the log file to determine the primary username being used to log in.

#### Instructions:

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the `/student_day3/learning_awk` folder in your Ubuntu VM:
  
  1. Make a new directory named `learning_awk` in the `/home/sysadmin/Cybersecurity-Lesson-Plans/03-Terminal/student_day3`
  
  2. Move over `Update1_Combined_Access_logs.txt` into the directory `/student_day3/learning_awk`.

  3. Use the `awk` command to isolate out the fields for Time and Username from this file.

  4. Use redirection to place these results into a new file called `Update2_Combined_Access_logs.txt`.
