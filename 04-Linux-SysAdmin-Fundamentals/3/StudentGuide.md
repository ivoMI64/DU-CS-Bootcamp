## 4.3 Student Guide: Special Permissions and Managing Services

### Overview

Today's class will continue our introduction of Linux by covering more topics related to auditing a malfunctioning system, ranging from the `SUID`, `GUID`, and sticky bits, to service users, managing services, and securing the root account.

### Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, you should be able to to:

- Inspect and set file permissions for sensitive files on the system.
- Set file permissions on programs using the `SUID` or `GUID` bits.
- Manage and monitor services on the system, including removing unused services.
- Create and assign users for services.

### 01. Welcome and Review

Welcome to class. Last class, we practiced:

- Auditing passwords using `john`.
- Elevating privileges with `sudo` and `su`.
- Creating and managing users and groups.

Today we will inspect and set file permissions, then dive into a special kind of permission on the system before moving on to services and service users, and some physical security topics.

- While no system is completely safe, there are many steps we can take to make a system more difficult for an attacker to exploit.

- Our strategies revolve around reducing attack surfaces and continuing to practice the principle of least privilege.

- We will continue our junior Linux administrator scenario, learning a few more techniques to protect the system.  

- This week's homework will use all of the new techniques you have learned.

### 02. Access Controls and Permissions

How many of you have used Google Docs?

- Google Docs is a fantastic resource because we can choose who we share files with and what permissions they have when they receive the file—such as whether they can read, comment, or make edits to the file.

This function is an **access control**.  

- These controls determine which actions users are able to take on a file (edit, view, etc.).  

- **Permission** regulates who can take which actions. For example, Jane can read and write, but Ivan can only read.

Most of the day, we have been discussing why it's important to limit access on the system. Access controls and permissions also help us follow the principle of least privilege.

Linux has a very granular way of setting these permissions:

- Linux categorizes files, programs, and directories as items.

- Each item has permissions allowing or preventing access to **read**, **write**, and **execute**.  

- For each item, we specify the access that the **owner**, the **group**, and **others** have.

  - The _owner_ is typically the user that created the item. However, this can be changed.

  - The _group_ is typically the primary group of the owner. However, this can also be changed.  

  - _Others_ includes everyone who is not the owner, and not in the group.


#### Read, Write and Execute

For each of the three mentioned categories—owner, group, and other—we have three options we can manipulate: _read_, _write_ and _execute_.

- _Read_ determines if the item can be read.
- _Write_ determines if the item can be written to.
- _Execute_ determines if the item can be executed.

While _execute_ can be applied to a file, it really only has effect for items that can be _executed_, like a program or a directory.

For any given item, we can specify if the owner can _read_, _write_ or _execute_, if the group can _read_, _write_ or _execute_, and if others can _read_, _write_ or _execute_.

- This is called **Discretionary Access Control**, or **DAC**. It is called _discretionary_ because these permissions can be passed from one item to another. For instance, a directory may pass on its permissions to items inside it.

- We saw an example of an item passing its permissions to another item in our previous activity, when the program `less` passed on its root permissions to the `bash` shell that ran inside it.

This gives us nine options for any given item, and each option can either be allowed or not allowed in any combination.

- To keep things as concise as possible, when we view each of these options on the command line, they are abbreviated to one letter: `r` for _read_, `w` for _write_ and `x` for _execute_.

#### Permissions Demonstration Setup

In this demo we will create a file and a directory and look at the default permissions. Then, we will change these permissions to deny particular users and groups access.

 In order to read and manipulate these file permissions, we need the following commands:

- `ls -l` to show the permissions info.

- `chmod` to change the permissions info.

- `chown` to change the owner and group of a file.

The goal will not be how to use the commands, but rather learning the syntax of the permissions themselves and how to combine them with users and groups to create custom access controls.

#### Inspecting Permissions

We'll start by creating a file and inspecting its permissions.

Move into your Documents folder.

- Run `touch my_file` to create a file.

- Run `mkdir my_dir` to create a directory.

- Run `ls -l` to show these files and their permissions info. Our output should be similar to the following:

  ```
  drwxr-xr-x 2 Owner Group 4096 Month Day Time my_dir
  -rw-r--r-- 1 Owner Group 0 Month Day Time my_file
  ```

This list includes more information than just the file name. Let's use `my_file` as an example:

- File or directory permissions: `-rw-r--r--`

- Number of links to this file: `1`

- Username of file or directory owner: `owner`

- Group assigned to the file or directory: `group`

- Size (in bytes): `0`

- Date and time of last modification: This will be the date and time when the items were created.

- File or directory name: `my_file`

For this demo, we will focus only on the permissions, and cover the following:

- Permissions are always listed in the order of read, write and execute for the user, then group, then other.

Items that are directories will always be labeled `d`. Items that are files will always be labeled with a hyphen (`-`).

The next three characters will show the owner permissions:

- For the directory, the owner permissions is `rwx`, meaning the owner can read, write and execute for the directory.

- The execute permission allows a user to enter that directory with `cd` as opposed to just create files inside the directory (`w`) or list the files in the directory (`r`).

- For the file, permission is `rw-`, meaning the owner can read and write to the file. The `-` indicates the absence of permission for execute on the `my_file` file. The owner does not have permission to execute on the file.

- This makes sense, because the file isn't something that can be executed. If we wrote code into this file, and we wanted the computer to run it as a program, we could then enable the execute permission so it could be executed.

The middle three characters show the group permissions.

- For the directory, the group permission is `r-x`. The hyphen `-` indicates an absence of write permission.

- The group does not have permission to create files inside the `my_dir` directory, but anyone from the group can enter the directory and view the files inside it.

- For the file, the groups permissions are `r--` . The group can read the file, but it does not have permission to write to or execute the file.

The last three characters show the permissions for all other users:

- For the directory, other permission is `r-x`. All other users can read and execute for the directory. They can only move inside the directory and list the files inside. They cannot create files or otherwise change the contents of the directory.

- For the file, the permission is `r--`. Everyone on the system who is not the owner and not in the group can only read the `my_file` file. They do not have permission to change the file or execute it.

In summary:
- `my_file` has read and write enabled for the owner and only read enabled for the group and others.

- `my_dir` has read, write, and execute enabled for the owner but only read and execute for the group and others.


#### Changing the Owner and Group

Now we will change the owner and the group by using `chown`.

The command `sudo chown owner:group <item>` can change the owner or the group of a file or directory.

  - Syntax breakdown:

    - `sudo`: Only `root` can make ownership and group changes to an item, which is why we’re using `sudo`.
    - `chown`: Stands for _change owner_. This command can be used to change groups and owners of items.
    - `owner:`: The owner we are specifying for the item.
    - `group`: The group we are specifying for the item.
    - `<item>`: The item we want to change. It can be a file or a directory.

Next, we will change the owner and the group of `my_file` so that we are no longer the owner and we are no longer in the group.

- Run `sudo chown root:root my_file`

What effect will this change have on our permissions for the file?

- We are not the owner, and we are not in the group, so we now fall into the _other_ category.

  - Run `ls -l my_file` to verify the new permissions.

  - What permissions do we have now that we are in the other category?

    - Now we only have read permissions for `my_file`. We cannot write or make changes to it.

- Running `nano my_file` gives us a message from Nano stating we cannot make changes to the file.

- Running `rm my_file` demonstrates that we cannot delete the file either.

Because we have `sudo` access, we can still take any action we want _if_ we invoke those privileges. But without `sudo` access, we cannot edit this file.


#### Changing Permissions

We have the _nine_ options of _read_, _write_ and _execute_ for each of the _owner_, _group_ and _other_ categories.

These options can be changed using one of two notations:

- **Symbolic notation**: Uses the letters `r`, `w`, and `x` to set read, write, and execute permissions.

- **Octal notation**: Uses base-8 numbers to set file permissions. For example, `rwx` is `7` in octal. Octal notation will be covered in more depth momentarily.

If more comfortable, you can always use the symbolic notation when setting permissions yourself. But, octal notation will be relevant in your real-world job, so you should be familiar with it.

- Run `ls -l my_file`.

  - This file was created with the default permissions: `-rw-r--r--`.

We change permissions with the command `chmod`, which stands for _change mode_.

- Run `sudo chmod u=rw,g=rw,o=rw my_file`
  - Only `root` can make permissions changes, which is why we are using `sudo`.

  - The command reads: "Change permissions such that the user has read and write permissions; the group has read and write permissions; and 'others' have read and write permissions."

    - Confirm updated permissions by running `ls -l`.

- Run `nano my_file` and note that we can now edit the file again because we have given write access to the other category, which we are currently part of.

We can remove permissions by leaving out the `r`, `w`, or `x`, and can also remove them or add them for all three categories with a `-` or a `+`.

- Run `sudo chmod +x my_file`

- Run `ls -l my_file`

The `x` option has been set for each the owner, group _and_ other.

- Finally, run: `sudo chmod -x my_file`

  - Run: `ls -l`

  - We have removed the `x` permission from all three categories.

#### Octal Notation

Now, we will use octal notation to set permissions.

Permissions in octal notation are denoted by numbers. Just as `-`,`r`, `w`, and `x` represent specific permissions in symbolic; `0`,`1`,`2`, and `4` represent the same permissions in octal.

- `0` indicates that we have no permissions.

- `1` indicates that we can _execute_ the file.

- `2` indicates that we can _write_ to the file.

- `4` indicates that we can _read_ the file.

Unlike symbolic, in octal, we can add numbers. The sum of these numbers results in specific permission sets.

  - `4` indicates that we can only _read_ the file.

  - `6` indicates that we can _read_ and _write_. (_Read_ + _write_ = `4 + 2` = `6`)

  - `7` indicates that can _read_, _write_, and _execute_. (_Read_ + _write_ + _execute_ = `4 + 2 + 1` = `7`)

Run `sudo chmod 766 my_file`

- The numbers in `766` represent permissions for the owner, group, and world, respectively. In other words, the owner = 7, the group = 6, other = 6.

- Can you decipher the permission for the owner, group, and other?

  - The owner can read, write, and execute (`7`). The group can read and write (`6`). All others can read and write (`6`).

- Run `ls -l`

  - The permissions now read: `-rwxrw-rw-`.  While this notation tells us the same information as `766`, it is much less compact.

Another example:

  - Run `sudo chmod 444 my_file`. This will give everyone only _read_ permissions.

What command should we run to give everyone _read_ and _write_ permissions?

- To add `2` to each `4`, we will run the following command:

  `sudo chmod 666 my_file`

What command should we run to give the user _read_, _write_ and _execute_ permissions; the group _read_ and _execute_ permissions; and the others _read_ permissions?

- Run `chmod 754 my_file`


#### Summary

In this demo we created a file and a directory and looked at all the permissions users had by default. Then, we changed the permissions to deny particular users and groups access to this directory and file.

You can use the more intuitive symbolic notation but you should become familiar with octal notation, as it is very commonly used by system administrators.

We used the following commands:

- `ls -l` to show the permissions info.

- `chown user:group` to change the owner and group of a file.

- `chmod` to change the permissions info.

### 05. `SUID`, `GUID` and Sticky Bits

- Previously, we learned about permissions for files and folders and how we can set or remove `r`, `w` or `x` for every file or folder.

- We can specify whether an item's owner can read, write or execute an item; whether a group of users can read, write, or execute an item; and whether every user on the system can read, write, or execute an item.

- We learned about the use of `sudo` and that invoking the root user allows you to bypass any permissions that are set on an item and execute a command with root privileges.

- We learned how to assign the ability to use `sudo` for just one command to a particular user.

We will now look at "special bits," which provide unique permissions for programs in specific circumstances.

#### Special Permissions

There are a few unique circumstances in which **special permissions** can modify an item's permissions to allow more flexible application across users.

For example, look at the `passwd` command:

- The `passwd` command allows a user to change their password.

- However, in order to change a password in the system, the `passwd` program has to edit the `/etc/shadow` file where all the password hashes are stored.

- `passwd` has to have `root` privileges in order to edit the `/etc/shadow` file and update the password hash.

- Remember, we never edit the `/etc/passwd` file manually. It is only edited by the system when a user is created or removed, or when a user's password is changed and it is owned by the `root` user.

Rather than manually giving all users `sudo` access for this command and then making sure every new user added also gets `sudo` access, we can have `passwd` set to **always run on `root`, regardless of the user running the command**.

 - This setting is considered a **special permission**, designed for unique scenarios, that modifies an item's behavior for when standard permissions are not flexible enough.

There are three basic scenarios that call for special permissions:

1. Allowing multiple users to make changes to the same files inside a common directory.

2. Limiting users to _only_ make changes to their own files within a common directory.

3. Allowing any user on the system to run a specific program as the root user.

    - This scenario is the case for the previous `passwd` example.  

For each of these three scenarios, there is a different special bit setting that we can implement into an item's permissions.

#### Special Bits

If we think of the `r`, `w`, and `x` bits as the standard characters that set an item's permissions, the _special bits_ are the characters we add to the item's permissions for those unique circumstances:

- Special bits are displayed alongside the permissions of an item, where the _execute_ bit normally is.

  - The `x` setting is still present, it's just not displayed.

- The special bit and the execute settings are used in conjunction with each other. When using a special bit, you first allow execute permissions before setting the special bit.

- There are three special bit options, one for each of the `x` permissions: owner, group, and  other.


- We can enable or disable these bits using the same `chmod` command we learned in the previous class, and we can use either symbolic or octal notation.


The **Sticky** bit resides in the execute position for the **other** permissions.
  - Restricts users from making changes to other users' files inside a shared directory.

  - Is displayed with a `t` in the place of the `x` for the other permissions: `drwxrwxrwt`.

  - If set without first setting the `x`, is indicated with a capital `T`: `drwxrwxrwT`.

  - It can be set with `chmod o+t` or `chmod 1000`.

The **Set Group ID** (`SGID`) bit resides in the execute position for the **group** permissions.
  - Grants all users the same permissions as the group assigned to a shared directory.

  - Allows multiple users to make changes to the same directory.

  - Displayed with an `s` in the place of the `x` for the group permissions: `-rwxrwsr-x`.

  - If it is set without first setting the `x`, will be indicated with a capital `S`: `-rwxrwSr-x`.

  - It can be set with `chmod g+s` or `chmod 2000`.

  - The `SGID` bit _can_ be set on a file. However, the effect is similar to setting the `SUID`, so it is rarely done.


    **Note**: the `SGID` and sticky bits can be used together to allow a group of users to collaborate in the same directory. When set together, they allow users to make changes to the same directory, but only to files that they own.


The **Set User ID** (`SUID`) resides in the execute permission for the **owner** permission.
- Allows any user to run a program as if they were the owner of that program.

- Usually used with executable files owned by `root`, giving any user the ability to execute that file with root permissions.

- Only used on files that have the `x` bit set in the owner position. In other words, it is only used on executable files or programs.

- A correct configuration displays an `s` in the place of the `x` for the user permissions: `-rwsr-xr-x`.

- In the event that the `x` is not set prior to setting the `SUID`, a capital `S` is shown to signal misconfiguration: `-rwSr-xr-x`.

- It can be set with `chmod u+s` or `chmod 4000`.



Of the three special bits, the `SUID` bit is the most important for security.

- The Set User ID or `SUID` bit will be the focus of the upcoming demo and activity.

- This bit is important to understand as it has similar vulnerabilities as `less`, which we covered in the previous class.


Setting the `SUID` bit is reserved for a few system programs like `passwd`.

- These programs have been well-tested for vulnerabilities and, so far, have been found secure.

- This setting should not be used on other programs, no matter how convenient it might be.

- Attackers often try to change this bit on programs they know they can exploit later.

Run `ls -l /usr/bin/passwd`. The output should be:

```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root
```
- `root` has `rwx`, the `root` group has `r-x`, and everyone else has `r-x`.

Each process running on the system shows the user that started the process.

Normally, when a program is run, the system runs it under the user that started the process.  

-  However, in this case, everyone has permission to execute the `passwd` program. But no matter who starts it, it will run as if it was started by the `root` user, because `root` is the owner of the `passwd` program and the `SUID` bit is set.


#### Demo Setup

In the upcoming demo, we will use the following scenario:

- A web developer at your company asked for `sudo` access to run the `find` command on a web server, so he can search the entire system for misplaced configuration files. He also stated that other developers will want the same privilege and suggested setting the `SUID` bit on the `find` command so they can all use `find` with root privileges.

This demo will explore _how_ to change this setting, and _why_ we should not. By the end of the demo, we will find that setting the `SUID` bit is dangerous, as it opens a vulnerability for attackers to perform privilege escalations.

To complete this demo, we will:

- Turn on the `SUID` setting of the `find` command.

- Confirm that this introduces a vulnerability to the system.

- Turn off the `SUID` setting for the `find` command.

- Search the system for other programs that have the `SUID` bit set.

To accomplish these tasks we only need a few familiar commands:

- `chmod` to change each bit.

- `find` to find all of the files and directories that have one of these bits set.


#### `find` Demo

We will now look at the `find` command as described in our administrator scenario.

Display the path of the `find program`:

- Run `which find`

  ```bash
  $ which find
  /usr/bin/find
  ```

List the contents and note that the current permissions do not have `SUID` set.

- Run `ls -l /usr/bin/find`

  ```bash
  $ ls -l /usr/bin/find
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 252848 Nov 5 2018 /usr/bin/find
  ```

Set the `SUID` bit.

- Run `sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/find`

  ```bash
  $ sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/find
  ```

Display the new permissions.

- Run `ls -l /usr/bin/find`

  ```bash
  $ ls -l /usr/bin/find
  -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 252848 Nov 5 2018 /usr/bin/find
  ```

To set this bit using octal notation, run `sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/find`.

- Syntax breakdown:

    - `4` sets the `SUID` bit.

    - `7` sets `r`, `w` and `x` for the user.

    - `5` sets `r` and `x` for the group.

    - `5` sets `r` and `x` for everyone else.


- Run `ctrl + u` or `ctrl + l` to clear the prompt.

If `find` is running as `root`, it can search through all the directories on a system without permissions errors, so setting the `SUID` bit here may seem to make sense.

Remember what happened when the program `less` was run with `sudo`:

- That vulnerability emphasized the dangers of running a program with root privileges.

- Once `less` is running with root privileges, anything `less` can do, it will do it with root privileges, including running other commands.

Remember that you must use `find` with the `-exec` flag to run another command on the list resulting from `find`.

-  The `-exec` flag lets you run _another_ command directly after the `find` command. The `-exec` flag is just an option for `find`, so it _also_ runs with the same permissions as `find`.

In order to take advantage of this vulnerability, we want to search for an item we already know exists, so we can use the `-exec` command right after to run another command. In other words, `find` will have to return something in order for us to use the `exec` flag and a second command. The second command does need to use the output of the first command; it *only* needs the first command to have something returned.

First we will run a regular `find` command.

- Run `find /etc -iname passwd`

   - Syntax breakdown:

        - `find` runs the search command.
        - `/etc` is the location we are searching.
        - `-iname` stands for _in name_ and means that we are searching for a specific  string in the name of the item.
        - `passwd` this is the string we are searching for in the name of the item.

We are intentionally searching for `passwd` inside the `/etc` directory, because we know that `/etc/passwd` exists and our find command will be successful.

- Output should be:

  ```bash
  /etc/cron.daily/passwd
  /etc/pam.d/passwd
  /etc/passwd
  ```

We are searching inside a directory owned by `root` and we are not getting any permissions errors. This is because the `SUID` bit is set and `find` is running as `root`.

To use the `-exec` flag, run `find /etc -iname passwd -exec ls -l {} \;`.

   Syntax breakdown:

- `find /etc -iname passwd` is searching the `/etc` directory for anything with `passwd` in the name.
-  `-exec` allows us to run another command directly after find.
- `ls -l` is a command that lists the _long form_ of the item.
-  `{}` indicates the list of items returned from the `find /etc -iname passwd` part of the command.
- `\;` closes the find command.

In this case, the `ls -l` command is _also_ running as root.

- Run `find /etc -iname passwd -exec ls -l {} \;`

- The output should be:

  ```bash
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root ... /etc/cron.daily/passwd
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root ... /etc/pam.d/passwd
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root ... /etc/passwd
  ```

Remember that the output of the first `find` command doesn't need to be used by the second command. In other words, we can run a second command that doesn't have  anything to do with the output of the initial `find` search.

Remember that the `whoami` command displays the user that is running that command.

- Run `find /etc -iname passwd -exec whoami \;`

    - Syntax breakdown:

        - `find /etc -iname passwd` is searching the `/etc` directory for anything with `passwd` in the name.
        - `-exec` runs a second command on each item returned by the first command.
        - `whoami` shows what user is present.
        - `\;` closes out the find command.

- Output should be:

    ```bash

    root
    root
    root

    ```

`whoami` was run for each time an item came back from the `find` search.

- We didn't need to use `{}` for this command, because we aren't trying to run `whoami` _on_ each item of the output of the `find` command.

- Instead we just want `whoami` to run independently.

What are some _other_ commands you could run that might be more sinister?

- This vulnerability would allow us to read sensitive files or install malicious packages.

This is another example of why root privileges must be restricted. It also demonstrates that using the `SUID` bit must be reserved for programs that have been fully tested for security holes.

It is common for administrators to keep a list of all the files that have these bits set on a fresh system, and then refer to that list later to make sure no changes have been made.

- The files that are set by default are established Linux programs that have been well-tested for vulnerabilities.

- It is best practice _not_ to set these bits on your own files or programs and to monitor for changes, as attackers like to exploit these weaknesses.

What is the best way to locate all of the programs on a machine that have the `SUID` bit set?

- The `find` command actually has a function for searching by permissions using the `-perm` flag.

- We can use either symbolic or octal notation here.

- Type `find / -perm -u+s -type f`

   - Syntax breakdown:

        - `sudo` would normally be used, but `find` currently has the `SUID` bit set, so we don't need to include `sudo` here.
        - `find` searches the system for files and directories.
        - `/` indicates that we are starting our search from the `root` directory and searching the entire system.
        - `-perm` is the flag that searches by permissions.
        - `-u+s` is the symbolic notation that sets the `SUID` bit.
        - **Note:** `-` must be used here, otherwise it will search for an _exact_ match, or files that _only_ have the `SUID` bit set and no other permissions.

Change the `-u+s` portion of the command to octal notation.

Type `find /perm -4000 -type f`

- Syntax breakdown:

    - `-4000` is the octal notation for the `SUID` bit.
  - **Note:** `-` must be used here, otherwise it will search for an exact match, or files that only have the `SUID` bit set and no other permissions.

Run the command. Your output should be similar to this:

```bash
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/qubes/qfile-unpacker
/usr/lib/xorg/Xorg.wrap
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/sbin/pppd
/usr/sbin/exim4
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/find
/usr/bin/sudo
/sbin/pam-tmpdir-helper
/opt/brave.com/brave/brave-sandbox
/bin/ntfs-3g
/bin/su
/bin/umount
/bin/fusermount
/bin/mount
/bin/ping
```

Except for the `find` command, the programs listed here have `SUID` set by default and have been well-tested.

Many administrators will save this list to a file and use it during an audit to verify nothing has changed.

Finally, we want to remove the `SUID` permission for `find`.

To remove the `SUID` bit for `find` using symbolic notation:

- Run `sudo chmod u-s /usr/bin/find`

In order to remove the `SUID` bit using octal notation, we just use a `0` in the special bit location.

Type `sudo chmod 0755 /usr/bin/find`

   - Syntax breakdown:

        - `0` removes any special bit set.
        - `7` sets read, write and execute for the owner permissions.
        - `5` sets read and execute for the group permissions.
        - `5` sets read and execute for the other permissions.

Run `ctrl + u`  or `ctrl + l` to clear the prompt.

Run `ls -l /usr/bin/find` to verify your permissions are back to normal. Output should be:

```bash
$ ls -l /usr/bin/find
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 252848 Nov 5 2018 /usr/bin/find
```

### 09. Managing Services

- The next lecture, demo, and activity will focus on managing services, a common activity for sysadmins.

#### A Brief Introduction to Services and the SMB Exploit

- **Servers** are just computers that offer **services** to other computers.

- A **service** is a function/capability that one machine makes available to another. For example, file sharing services allow computers to send and receive data.

- Some services are only run locally on the server and not provided to other computers. Tripwire is an example of a local security service.

- These services are packages that you can install and remove, just like other programs.

Manipulating services to do things they are not designed to do is a common form of attack.

- Administrators are responsible for securing services that are running and removing services that are not in use.

- It's crucial for system administrators to be able to start, stop, and inspect services, to ensure they're running when they should be.

In this following demo, you will `find`, `stop`, and `uninstall` an unnecessary Samba file-sharing service.

Samba (also known as SMB) is a protocol that allows users to view, download, and store files remotely.

- It is commonly used for file-sharing among Windows computers, but Linux can use it as well.

- SMB is extremely useful for legitimate users, but has obvious security risks.

- If a malicious user is able to gain access to a shared folder, they can exfiltrate, alter, or delete sensitive files.

- SMB can be secured, but often isn't. Attackers frequently target SMB and similar services for just this reason.

#### Finding and Stopping SMB Demo

Since this server has already been compromised, you will proceed by stopping the SMB service, and then uninstalling it from the system. This will require the following steps:

1. Listing all running services.

2. Identifying the Samba service in the list to verify that it's running, then stopping it.

3. Ensuring that Samba doesn't start when the machine is started up.

4. Ensuring that Samba is no longer running.

5. Uninstalling the Samba service completely.

`systemctl` has a lot of options, but, to complete these actions, we only need to know the following:

- `systemctl -t service --all` to list all the running services.

- `sudo systemctl stop <service-name>` to stop the service.

- `sudo systemctl disable <service-name>` to stop a service from starting automatically when the machine starts.

- `systemctl status <service-name>` to determine if a single service is running.

- `apt-get remove <service-package-name>` to remove the service from the system.

Run `systemctl -t service --all`

- Syntax breakdown:

    - `-t` stands for type.
    - `--all` ensures that we see all the available services on the system, even if they aren't running.

Output should be similar to:

```bash
 UNIT                                  LOAD      ACTIVE   SUB    DESCRIPTION                           
  apparmor.service                     loaded    inactive dead    AppArmor initialization                                          
  apt-daily-upgrade.service            loaded    inactive dead    Daily apt upgrade and clean activities                           
  apt-daily.service                    loaded    inactive dead    Daily apt download activities                                    
  auditd.service                       not-found inactive dead    auditd.service                                                   
  avahi-daemon.service                 loaded    inactive dead    Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD Stack                                          
```

Note the following:

- `UNIT` has the name of the service.

- `LOAD` shows if the service module is found on the system or not.

- `ACTIVE` shows the high-level, general state of the service.

- `SUB` shows the low-level, detailed service state (this changes depending on the service).

- `DESCRIPTION` describes the service.

We can easily see services that the system has searched for and are not found on the system. Those are marked in red under the `LOAD` column and have a yellow dot to the left of the service name.

We will practice how to identify the `smbd` process and then stop and disable it.

We are _enabling_ and _disabling_ a service to configure whether or not it starts automatically on system boot.

- Run `systemctl -t service --all` and note the `smbd` service.

- Run `sudo systemctl status smbd` to get the status of the `smbd` service.

- Your output should be similar to:

  ![Output image](Images/smb_status.png)

  - Note the service is marked as `Active: active (running)`.

- Run `sudo systemctl stop smbd` to stop the service.

- Run `sudo systemctl status smbd` to get the status of the `smbd` service again.

- Your output should be similar to:

  ![Output image](Images/smb_status_2.png)

  - Note the service is marked as `Active: inactive (dead)`.

- Run  `sudo systemctl disable smbd`

Services are just packages. To remove a package, run `sudo apt-get remove <service name>`.

- Run `sudo apt-get remove samba`

If you accidentally `stop` or `disable` the wrong service, you can use `start` and `enable` to reverse the action.

We have removed Samba from the system, so the following commands won't work. But if we wanted to start and enable that service, we would use:

- `sudo systemctl enable smbd` to enable a service.

- Press `ctrl + u` or  or `ctrl + l` to clear the prompt.

-  `sudo systemctl start smbd` to start a service.

### 12. Service Users

So far, we have found and removed a vulnerability with the `find` command using the `SUID` and `SGID` bits. Then, we found and removed some old, unused, and insecure services.

Next, we are going to look at managing service users and then end the day with a section on securing the root account.

- Services should run in a user dedicated to running that service.

- Running services in a dedicated user offers a number of security benefits. In particular, it makes it easier to start, stop, and manage the service, and control which files the user's permissions need to access.

- A service user usually has a system UID under 1000 and is not able to log in to use a shell.

  - Assigning service users a UID under 1000 is a convention of Linux. It makes it easier to determine at a glance who is a "normal" user and who is a service user.

  - Since service users are not humans who need to log in and interact with the machine, it's best practice to ensure that service usernames cannot log in to interactive shells.

    - For example, it should be impossible to log in to a bash session as the `www-data` user.

    - This reduces the number of ways attackers can gain shell access.

  - All users are assigned a shell for logging in by default. Linux has a shell called `nologin` that is assigned to service users, and does not allow a login.

- Typically, when you install a service with the package manager, a service user is automatically created and configured.

- It is a best practice to run a service only with the privileges that it needs. Sometimes, a service needs to start as `root` but can then run other processes under service user.

#### Set Up Removing and Adding Service Users Demo

Your senior administrator has asked you to follow up on uninstalling unused services by ensuring the services' corresponding users have also been removed from the system. Previously, you disabled `apache2` and `nginx`, but its service user, `www-data`, still exists.

- Additionally, your senior administrator plans to install a security service called Splunk, a tool for collecting and analyzing logs for suspicious activity. Along with tools like Tripwire, Splunk makes it much easier for administrators and security personnel to detect and stop malicious behavior.

- They've told you that they'll handle the installation and configuration themselves, but have requested that you lay the groundwork by creating a service user.

In this demonstration, we'll demonstrate how to:

- Delete an old, unused service user with `deluser`.

- Create and validate a new service user with `adduser`.

These commands will use some flags that you haven't seen yet.

- **When deleting a user:** `--remove-all-files` will remove any file for which the user is the owner, including the home folder and all its contents.

- **When creating a user:** `--system` creates a user with a `UID` under 1000, sets the login shell to `/sbin/nologin`, locks the user from logging in, and does not assign it a password.

  - Assigning the user `/sbin/nologin` gives that user a shell that does not allow a login.

  - If the shell assignment were changed, the user would still be locked and unable to log in.

- `--no-create-home` will create a user without a home folder.

  - Because the user isn't a human user, it does not need any dedicated space to save files.

#### Adding and Removing Service Users Demo

Begin the demonstration by identifying the `www-data` user.

- Run `less /etc/passwd` and note the `www-data` user in the list.

We want to remove that user along with any files it created. We also want to remove the group by the same name.

- Run `less /etc/group` to show that the group still exists,  as well.

- Type `sudo deluser --remove-all-files www-data`

  - The `--remove-all-files` flag will remove every file created by that user, including the home folder for that user and the system group by the same name.

- Run `sudo deluser --remove-all-files www-data`

- Run `less /etc/passwd` and note that the user for `www-data` entry has been removed.

- Run `tail /etc/group` to show that the group is gone.

We will now create a user for the Splunk service that the administrator would like to install.

- Run `sudo adduser --system --no-create-home splunk`

The `--system` flag creates a user with a `UID` under 1000, sets the login shell to `/usr/sbin/nologin`, and locks the user without a password.

The `--no-create-home` flag creates a user without a home folder.

- Run `less /etc/passwd` and note that the user has been created.

  - The `shell` has been set to `/usr/sbin/nologin`.

  - The `UID` is less than 1000.

Type `q` to exit `less`.

We could also use the `id` command to verify the `UID` is under 1000.

- Run `id splunk` to verify that the `UID` is under 1000.

- Run `ls /home` to show that no home folder was created the `splunk` user.

- Run `tail /etc/group` to verify that a `splunk` group was created.

We can see password entries in the `/etc/shadow` file.

- Run `sudo tail /etc/shadow` to verify this user doesn't have a password.

The `*` in the password field for the `splunk` user. This means the user is locked without a password.

After you set up a service user, you would schedule the user to run the service as needed.

Scheduling programs to run at certain times is a topic for next week's class. For now, we just want to be able to manage creating and removing the user itself.

### 15. End of Class

For homework for this week, you will practice all of the hardening steps you have learned this week, but on a new system. You will also be running a few new tools—`chkrootkit` and `lynis`, and configure Tripwire.

The instructions to configure Tripwire describe each change you must make, so you don't have to research this yourself.

However, to work properly, this configuration requires very specific changes. Be sure to follow the instructions precisely.

After the system is hardened with the steps you learned, you will use the output of `lynis` to create a report detailing further steps that could be taken to harden the system.

It is common to have to look up instructions for software you aren't familiar with. Having to follow instructions perfectly in order for something to work is also common.
