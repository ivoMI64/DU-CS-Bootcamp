## Activity File: Users, Groups, and Password Policies

- In the last activity, we took a brief break from reporting and uninstalled applications using the Windows apps GUI and command line. In this activity, we will return to the command ine to gather more information for our `report.txt` file.

- Your CIO is curious about the groups and password policies on the Windows workstation. Continue retrieving information from this Windows workstation using the `net` command-line utility.

- Please continue to use the **Windows 10 Hyper-V virtual machine**. 

Note: Before continuing with your activities, remember to `cd` to the `Desktop/reports` directory.
